"A big part of Vyper's \"public API\" is the language grammar. The syntax "
"of the language is the main touchpoint all parties have with Vyper, so "
"it's important to discuss changes to the language from the viewpoint of "
"dependability. Users expect that all contracts written in an earlier "
"version of Vyper will work seamlessly with later versions, or that they "
"will be reasonably informed when this isn't possible. The Vyper package "
"itself and its CLI utilities also has a fairly well-defined public API, "
"which consists of the available features in Vyper's `exported package "
"<https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/master/vyper/__init__.py>`_, the"
" top level modules under the package, and all CLI scripts."

"Changes to the grammar cannot be made in a backwards incompatible way "

"expected that breaking changes to many features will occur when updating "
"to a new Major release, primarily for Developers that use Vyper to "
"compile their contracts. Major releases will have an audit performed "
"prior to release (e.g. ``x.0.0`` releases) and all ``moderate`` or "
"``severe`` vulnerabilities will be addressed that are reported in the "
"audit report. ``minor`` or ``informational`` vulnerabilities *should* be "
"addressed as well, although this may be left up to the maintainers of "
"Vyper to decide."

"<https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/policy>`_ to resolve these "
"issues, and eventually will publish the details of all reported "
